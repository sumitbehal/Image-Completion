# Image-Completion
In this project, I used some tactics over RGB values of various pixels to detect the black spots on the video.
First, video was broken down into frames and then solving the problem for every frame.
Goal was to complete the image and removing black square from various frames and then merge them again to form a the new video.

PS: I have used plenty of for loops, if you think you can contribute to reduce them! Project is open for contribution 
and this will improve the code quality!
